# Lesson 1.4: The 411 on 911

For those of you who are old enough to remember, on September 11th, most of the air traffic in the USA came to a halt.  We should be able to dig around in the flight traffic records and explore what actually happened.

First, lets take a look at flights on and around 9/11.  

## What did flight traffic look like the week of 9/11?

We start by counting the number of flights on each day from 2001-09-10 for the week.  Let's sort it by days and graph it.

To figure this out we start [exploring Flights](explore/faa/flights), and add a filter for the dates we're looking for. For this review, we'll include all the information on how we gathered data:

    Filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-10 for 7 Days
    Dimensions:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date
    Measures:
       FLIGHTS Flights Count

The resulting graph is:
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  type: looker_column
  explore: flights
  dimensions: flights.depart_date
  measures: flights.count
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>


Huh - it looks like there was no change in the number of flights, even on 9/11.  

## Getting to the real story - how many flights were actually completed that week?

If we look at the measures available to us by scanning the field picker, we can see there is a '% Complete' measure. This shows us the percentage of flights that reached their destination.  Let's re-run this query with that field added.

    Filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-10 for 7 Days
    Dimensions:
       FlIGHTS Departed Date
    Measures:   
       FLIGHTS Flights Count
       FLIGHTS Percent Completed
 
Resulting in: 
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  type: looker_column
  explore: flights
  dimensions: flights.depart_date
  measures: [flights.count, flights.percent_complete]
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>
 

That's more like it.  We can see that on 9/10, the flight complete rate was near 100%.  On 9/11 the complete rate is around 15%, but drops to essentially 0 on 9/12.  On 9/13, some flights take to the air and we are back at 50% on 9/14.
 
## Who started flying first?
 
To figure this out, we can drill into the 9/13, 9/14 and 9/15 and group by carrier to see which carriers took to the air first.  We group by both carrier and date.  We pivot the dates columns to see that Aloha was completing 97% of its flights by 9/14.  

    Filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-13 for 3 Days
    Dimensions:
       CARRIERS Name
       FlIGHTS Departed Date
    Measures:   
       FLIGHTS Percent Completed
    Pivots:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date
       
Here is the same information as a table:
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  explore: flights
  dimensions: [flights.depart_date, carriers.name]
  pivots: flights.depart_date
  measures: [flights.count, flights.percent_complete]
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>

And as a graph:
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  explore: flights
  type: looker_column
  dimensions: [flights.depart_date, carriers.name]
  pivots: flights.depart_date
  measures: [flights.count, flights.percent_complete]
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>


## How about other states?
 
Aloha was flying in Hawaii on 9/14, but what about airlines in other states? 

    Filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-13 for 3 Days
    Dimensions:
       ORIGIN State
    Measures:
       FLIGHTS Percent Completed

Looking at the percent of completed flights by state shows us that the East Coast remained pretty shut down, but the center of the country and the West Coast started flying again.
