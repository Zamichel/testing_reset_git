# 411 on 911

Those of you that are old enough to remember, on 911, most of the air traffic in the USA came to a halt.  We should be able to dig around in the flight traffic records and see what actually happened back then.  The Looker example database has 38M flights starting 2001-01-01 extending through 2005.  

First, lets take a look at the flight in and around 9/11.  We start by counting the number of flights on each day from 2001-09-10 for the week.  Let's sort it by days and graph it.

To figure this out we start [exploring flights base view](explore/faa/flights), add a 
filter 

    filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-10 for 7 Days
    Fields:
       FlIGHTS Departed Date
       Flights Flights Count

The resulting graph is:
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  type: looker_column
  base_view: flights
  dimensions: flights.depart_date
  measures: flights.count
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>

 
Thats weird, it looks like there was no change in the number of flights.  
 
If we look at the measures available to us, we can see there is a '% Complete' measure. This shows us the percentage of flights that were reached their destination.  Let's rerun this exploration with that field added.

    filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-10 for 7 Days
    Fields:
       FlIGHTS Departed Date
       Flights Flights Count
       Flights Percent Completed
 
Resulting in: 
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  type: looker_column
  base_view: flights
  dimensions: flights.depart_date
  measures: [flights.count, flights.percent_complete]
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>
 
 
That's more like it.  We can see that on 9/10, the flight complete rate was near 100%.  On 9/11 the complete rate is around 15%, but drops to essentially 0 on 9/12.  On 9/13, some flights take to the air and we are back at 50% 9/14.
 
## Who started flying first?
 
To figure this out, we can drill into the 9/13, 9/14 and 9/15 and group by carrier see which carriers took to the air.  We group by both carrier and date.  We make the Dates columns (this is called pivotting) and we can see that Aloha was completing 97% of its flights by 9/14.  I guess airtravel is pretty essential in Hawaii.

    filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-13 for 3 Days
    fields:
       CARRIERS Name
       FlIGHTS Departed Date
       FLIGHTS Percent Completed
    pivots:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date
       
Here it is as a table:
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  base_view: flights
  dimensions: [flights.depart_date, carriers.name]
  pivots: flights.depart_date
  measures: [flights.count, flights.percent_complete]
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>

And as a graph:
 
<look height="350" width="100%">
  model: faa
  base_view: flights
  type: looker_column
  dimensions: [flights.depart_date, carriers.name]
  pivots: flights.depart_date
  measures: [flights.count, flights.percent_complete]
  sorts: flights.depart_date
  filters:
    flights.depart_date: 2001-09-10 for 7 days
</look>


 
## How about other states?
 
Aloha was flying in hawaii Hawaii on the 9/14, how about other states? Was the slow down regional?  

    filters:
       FLIGHTS Departed Date: 2001-09-13 for 3 Days
    fields:
       ORIGIN State
       FLIGHTS Percent Completed

Looking at % Complete fights by state shows us that the east cost remained pretty shut down, but the center and west started flying.
